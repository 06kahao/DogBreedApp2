### Dog Breed Identifier App

**Description:**  Using transfer learning, this app takes the pre-trained convolutional neural net Xception,
 restructures it to only predict 133 different dog breeds, 
and trains the neural net on a little over 8,500 dog images. However, since the neural net is only
trained to recognize dog image features, it is automatically capable of determining 
which dog breed a human image most closely resembles.

**Instructions:**  Hit upload and upload an image of a dog (or yourself) and hit predict.

**Credits:**  Training images courtesy of Udacity.
